# **Cybersecurity Workshop: Hands-On Exploitation Techniques**

This 2-hour workshop dives deep into practical cybersecurity attacks and defense mechanisms. Participants will explore key exploitation tools and techniques used in real-world scenarios, focusing on:

- **Phishing Attacks**: Using tools like [CAM Phish](https://github.com/techchipnet/CamPhish) and [Phishing tool](https://github.com/mamba-9mm/phishing) to simulate phishing campaigns.
- **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)**: Setting up and using **Bettercap** for network interception.
- **Network Scanning**: Analyzing networks with **nmap**, **dirb**, and **FING**.
- **Password Cracking**: Implementing brute-force and dictionary attacks using **Hashcat** and **Hydra**.
- **WiFi Attacks**: Exploiting WiFi networks with **De-Author** and **Evil Twin** tools.
- **Social Engineering**: Crafting social engineering attacks with **Email Phisher (SET)**.
- **DDoS**: Executing denial-of-service attacks using **hping3**.
- **Remote Desktop Connections**: Leveraging **NETCAT** and **msfconsole** for remote access.
- **BLE Spamming**: Disrupting Bluetooth devices using **BLE-Spammer** tools.

By the end of this session, attendees will gain hands-on experience with offensive and defensive security techniques, equipping them with the skills to safeguard and evaluate system vulnerabilities.
